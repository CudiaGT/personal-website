I recently started playing tennis again with my roommates and I am hoping that it will continue to be a sport that I can play throughout the winter."

The goal of this project was to build on top of the linear programming solver assigned as one of the assignments to incorporate features that allow the solver to deal with linear programming problems in integers and incorporate visual components through utilization of the Matplotlib library in Python. The project mainly utilizes the Branch and Bound approach for integer linear programming and uses the SymPy library for matrix computation.",
